Hi! Kareeb Here!

  Ok. First I would like to introduce myself as priamrily a game developer. Currently I am working on one huge project called Project Wasley. An action-based FPS game. Though I'm mainly working on it solo I do have friends of mine helping with design,  features, story, and art.
  
  I also run two YT channels. First one being the name of this account and the other being just my REAL name: Kareeb Hassan.
  
  Tbh as of writing this I am particualarly new to github. But other than that...
  
  yeah.
  
  Ok bye bye now :)
